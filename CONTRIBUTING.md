## Development Setup

### Setup PyEnv 

1. [Install PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout)

2. Add PyEnv to your `.bash_profile`

```sh
export PYENV_ROOT=$HOME/.pyenv
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PYENV_ROOT/bin
export PATH
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Note that this will not take effect unti your next login session.
In the meantime, you can `source ~/.bash_profile`.

### Run the test suite

```sh
pyenv install 3.9.13
pyenv local 3.9.13
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
make test
```

## Deployment

In GitHub, under 
`Secrets` then `Actions` add the following `Repository Secrets`:

`SOAR_HOSTNAME` set to `automate-illinois.soar.splunkcloud.com`
`SOAR_TOKEN` with your SOAR API token.

### Debugging Deployment

To read deploy logs, visit SOAR `Administration`, and look under `System Health` and then `Debugging`.
